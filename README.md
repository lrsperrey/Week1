Week 1 Homework  - Markdown
# LaKeisha Price
## This homework assignment is all about me and I really have no idea on what I would like to write.  Not that I am a boring person however; when it comes time to talk about myself my mind goes blank.  However, one fun thing that I like to learn more about and consider a hobby is history.  My focus this year is more on the community I was raised in.  It's located in Montgomery, AL and is called "Hunter Station".  I have always felt there was a great history behind the community and it is a huge part of who I am.
